## ⚒️ Main Process

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
* Loading Data

```
  df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Bản sao của mini-project2 .csv')
  df.head()
```

* Data overview, Check missing values, outlier detection and EDA using syntax

```
df.info()
df.describe()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11aaa2d3-6999-40e4-918a-8dbc0180f5a4)


=> The dataset has 24 features, none of them have mising values, there are 3 different data types: Float, Interger and Object

## 2️⃣ Feature Engineering

* Create new features by transforming to "trans_time"; "year_of_birth" to fit the format of running model

```
df["trans_time"] = pd.to_datetime(df['trans_date_trans_time']).dt.hour
df["year_of_birth"] = pd.to_datetime(df['dob']).dt.year
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aaf5a47-cf1f-424c-8a2f-8a2c8b6fbaf3)

* Endcode features "category" and "gender"
  
```
  list_columns = ['category','gender']
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=list_columns,drop_first=True,dtype=int)
```

* Encode states in US by group them into 4 regions  ➡️ 'get_dummies' the regions 'Northeast', 'Midwest', 'South', 'West'

```
list_columns = ['category','gender']
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=list_columns,drop_first=True,dtype=int)
state_to_region = {
    'Northeast': ['CT', 'ME', 'MA', 'NH', 'RI', 'VT', 'NJ', 'NY', 'PA'],
    'Midwest': ['IL', 'IN', 'MI', 'OH', 'WI', 'IA', 'KS', 'MN', 'MO', 'NE', 'ND', 'SD'],
    'South': ['DE', 'FL', 'GA', 'MD', 'NC', 'SC', 'VA', 'WV', 'AL', 'KY', 'MS', 'TN', 'AR', 'LA', 'OK', 'TX'],
    'West': ['AZ', 'CO', 'ID', 'MT', 'NV', 'NM', 'UT', 'WY', 'AK', 'CA', 'HI', 'OR', 'WA']
}
region_to_state = {state: region for region, states in state_to_region.items() for state in states}

# Map state codes to regions
df['region']=df['state'].map(region_to_state)

# Create dummy variables for regions
dummies = pd.get_dummies(df['region'], drop_first=False).astype(int)

df = pd.concat([df, dummies], axis=1)
```

* select top 20 jobs have highest fraud cases ➡️ encode top 20 jobs with highest fraud cases and the rest as 'others'

```
 #select top 20 jobs have highest fraud cases
fraud_counts = (df.groupby(['job'])['is_fraud'].sum()).sort_values(ascending=False)
job_counts = df["job"].value_counts()
df1 = pd.concat([fraud_counts,job_counts], axis=1)
df1.columns = ['fraud_counts','job_counts']
df1['fraud_rate']= (df1['fraud_counts']/df1['job_counts'])
df1 = df1.reset_index()
print(df1.head(20))
```

```
# entitle top 20 jobs with highest fraud cases and the rest as 'others'
top_categories  = [
    "Materials engineer",
    "Trading standards officer",
    "Naval architect",
    "Exhibition designer",
    "Surveyor, land/geomatics",
    "Mechanical engineer",
    "Prison officer",
    "Quantity surveyor",
    "Audiological scientist",
    "Copywriter, advertising",
    "Senior tax professional/tax inspector",
    "Film/video editor",
    "Scientist, biomedical",
    "Financial trader",
    "Television production assistant",
    "Buyer, industrial",
    "Private music teacher",
    "Podiatrist",
    "Nurse, children's",
    "Magazine features editor"
]
# Create a mapping
category_mapping = {title: title for title in top_categories}
category_mapping['others'] = 'others'

# Apply the mapping
df['encoded_job_title'] = df['job'].apply(lambda x: x if x in top_categories else 'others')

print(df)
# get_dummies the 'encoded_job_title'
encoded_df=pd.get_dummies(df['encoded_job_title'], prefix='job_title',drop_first=True,dtype=int)
df = pd.concat([df, encoded_df], axis=1)

print(df)
```

## Model Traning
```
# Select features and Split dataset
drop_features = ['Unnamed: 0.1','Unnamed: 0','trans_date_trans_time','cc_num','merchant','first','last','street','city','state','job','region','dob','trans_num','encoded_job_title','is_fraud']
X = df.drop(columns = drop_features)
y = df['is_fraud']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
#Select model RandomForest
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```
Random Forest is a smart choice for credit card fraud prediction because it balances robustness, flexibility, and performance, especially for imbalanced, noisy data, especially, Random Forest does not inherently require feature scaling (e.g., normalization or standardization)

## Model Evaluation
```
[[27050    55]
 [  315  1905]]
Accuracy: 0.99
F1 Score: 0.91
```
An accuracy of 99% sounds excellent at first glance—it means the model is correct 99% of the time. However, accuracy alone can be misleading, especially if the dataset is imbalanced (which seems to be the case here, as there are far more negatives (27,105) than positives (2,220))

The F1 score is given as 0.91, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, confirming the metrics are consistent and indicates the model performs well on the positive class despite the imbalance

==> This model 's performance  is quite good overall, with a strong F1 score indicating robustness despite imbalance
